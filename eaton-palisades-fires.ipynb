        "\n",
        "The Eaton and Palisades fires, which ignited almost simultaneously in early January 2025, showed not only the ecological vulnerability of Los Angeles County’s foothill and coastal wild-land urban interface zones but also the deep social dimensions embedded within wildfire disasters. Using remote sensing tools such as Landsat based false color imagery, environmental monitoring efforts can clearly delineate burn severity, vegetation loss and fire scar patterns that acts as critical information for assessing ecological recovery and guiding restoration. Yet the impacts of these fires extended far beyond the physical landscape. Thousands of homes were destroyed, tens of thousands of residents were displaced, and long standing inequities shaped who suffered most, who could rebuild and how quickly communities could recover. Factors such as income level, housing security, access to insurance, language barriers, transportation availability, and trust in public institutions strongly influenced how individuals responded to evacuation orders, accessed emergency services, and navigated post-fire assistance. By integrating advanced data visualization with an understanding of these social realities, environmental monitoring becomes not only a scientific exercise but also a tool for informing more just, community-centered wildfire resilience planning\n",

        "-   Maintain spatial accuracy by managing coordinate reference systems with `rio.write_crs()` and `to_crs()`.\n",

        "The social dimension of wildfire risk is closely tied to population vulnerability, particularly among elderly residents. In the Environmental Justice Index, the percentage of populations aged 65 and older 'E_AGE65' indicate the proportion of seniors within a community relative to others (0–100 scale). This metric matters for wildfire preparedness and response because older adults often face mobility limitations, pre-existing health conditions, and greater reliance on assistance for evacuation. They may also experience longer recovery times following fire events."
